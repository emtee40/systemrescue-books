== Appendix 3: Essential Commands
Here is a summary of essential commands which have been used throughout the various chapters. You can refer to this appendix to remind yourself which command to use for a particular use case. Please refer to the corresponding chapters if you need more context and details about what these commands do.

=== Documentation
Most commands come with a manual page which provides detailed documentation. These are accessible through the `man` command. For example, you can run `man dd` in a terminal to learn more about the `dd` command. Also most commands display a summary of each supported option when you execute the command followed by `--help` (eg: `lsblk --help`)

=== General commands
* `cd /path/to/directory` changes the current directory in the current shell
* `pwd` shows the path to the working directory in the current shell
* `ls -lh /path/to/directory` to show the contents of a directory on the file system
* `cat /path/to/file` shows the contents of a file
* `sha256sum /path/to/file` calculate the SHA256 checksum of a file
* `find /path/to/directory -name "filename"` searches for files with a particular name located in a particular directory

=== Controlling the firewall
* `systemctl is-active iptables ip6tables` shows if the firewall services are currently active
* `systemctl stop iptables ip6tables` stop the firewall services on the current system
* `iptables -S` and `ip6tables -S` shows the firewall policies and rules currently effective on the system

=== Identifying disks and partitions
* `lsblk -o path,size,fstype,label,model` shows the list of all disks and partitions as well as their main attributes.

=== Mounting a file system
* `mkdir -p /mnt/mount_point` creates a new directory which you can use as a mount point.
* `mount -v /dev/device_name /mnt/mount_point` mounts a file system on a directory. (Add `-o ro` at the end to mount it in read-only mode.)
* `umount /mnt/mount_point` unmounts the file system from a particular mount point.
* `df -hT /mnt/mount_point` shows how much disk space is available on a mounted file system.

=== Transferring files over the network
* `systemctl is-active sshd` shows if the sshd service is currently active.
* `systemctl restart sshd` restarts the sshd service on the current system.
* `systemctl stop sshd` stops the sshd service on the current system.
* `passwd root` changes the password of the root user account on the current system.
* `journalctl -f --unit=sshd` shows messages written by the sshd service.

=== Physical disk copies
* `blockdev --getsize64 /dev/device_name` shows the exact size of a disk or partition.
* `du -b /path/to/file` shows the exact size of a file.
* `dd if=input of=output status=progress` sequentially copies all data from the input to the output.
* `losetup --read-only -P --find --show /path/to/disk-image` creates a virtual loop device from a disk image file.
* `losetup -d /dev/loop_device` detaches a loop device from its image file.

=== Chroot
* `arch-chroot /mnt/mount_point` changes the effective root directory to a mounted file system.
* `umount --recursive /mnt/mount_point` unmounts a mounted file system and all recursive file systems.
