== Chapter 4: System Overview

=== Graphical environment
When you run the `startx` command in the initial console, the graphical environment appears. It is based on the lightweight XFCE desktop environment which comes with a traditional user interface.

The most important applications can be started directly from icons at the bottom of the screen. The XFCE icon in the bottom left corner gives you access to the application menu where you can find all other available graphical applications as well as settings such as the screen resolution. This menu also provides access to the `Log Out` entry, which you use to shutdown the computer properly at the end of your session. The network and the sound can be configured using icons located next to the clock on the right side of the screen.

=== Applications overview
Here is an overview of the key graphical applications that can be started from icons in the panel:

* The terminal is required to execute command-line programs and applications which run in text mode. It is used extensively in the following chapters.
* The web browser gives access to internet websites so you can search for tutorials for performing a particular operation and online documentation in general
* The graphical partition editor allows you to manipulate partitions on your disks. There is more information about how to use it in <<chapter_partitioning>>
* The graphical text editor lets you easily modify configuration files or write personal notes.
* The help icon provides an offline inventory which lists all programs that come with SystemRescue sorted by category.

The application menu gives access to many more programs. It is recommended that you review all the categories in the menu to know which graphical applications are available. Here is an overview of what you will find:

* There are utilities which provide detailed information about your hardware.
* Graphical file managers allow you to list, copy, move, rename or delete files.
* Other programs allow you to connect to other computers over the network using protocols such as VNC and RDP.
* Different types of text editors are included to suit everyone's preferences, and hexadecimal editors are provided to view or edit binary files.
* Some general tools such as a calculator can be helpful for example if you must calculate disk sizes to perform changes.

=== Documentation and user guides
As mentioned before, SystemRescue provides many programs to administrate your system, but you are in charge of the whole process and you must know which tools to use and how to use them.

The following chapters provide step-by-step instructions for performing some common operations. But the tools included in SystemRescue can do much more, and you need to know how to get started.

The program inventory, which is accessible from the help icon on the panel, is a good starting point. It provides a list of available administration tools. As most programs must be executed as command lines from the terminal, they do not have corresponding icons in the application menu. You can find which programs correspond to your needs using this inventory.

Command-line programs normally come with an offline manual. These can be accessed using the `man` command in the terminal. For example, `man gdisk` displays the manual for the `gdisk` program, as shown on the following screenshot. You can scroll using the arrows keys, or Page-up/Page-down, and press `q` to quit.

These manuals provide a description of the application and an exhaustive list of the parameters that the command supports. They are very useful as reference documentation. To get started with new programs, it is recommended that you do some research on the internet to find guides that are more accessible.
