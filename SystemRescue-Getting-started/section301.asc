== Appendix 1: Boot Parameters
Here are the most common boot parameters. Please refer to <<chapter_starting>> for more details about the main optional boot parameters.

=== Mandatory boot parameters
* **archisolabel=xxxx** defines the volume name of the file system from which SystemRescue loads its files during the initialisation.
* **archisobasedir=xxxx** defines the base directory where all SystemRescue files reside. This option allows you to install SystemRescue in a custom directory.

=== Optional boot parameters
* **copytoram** causes SystemRescue to be fully loaded into memory. This option is recommended unless your computer does not have enough memory.
* **checksum** triggers a verification of the integrity of the boot image. You should use this boot option if you get unexpected errors when running SystemRescue.
* **setkmap=xxxx** configures the keyboard layout using a specific keyboard map code (such as `de` for German keyboards). Run `setkmap` in a terminal to get a list of all supported layouts.
* **nofirewall** disables the firewall so you can establish connections to the SystemRescue live system from outside.
* **nomodeset** runs the system with a basic lower resolution display driver. Use this option if the default display settings are not working.
