== Preface
SystemRescue is a Linux-based toolkit for computer administration and recovery. It is available for free. It runs from removable devices such as USB memory sticks, so it can be used on computers on which the operating system has stopped working. It allows users to perform many essential operations, such as recovering data files, partitioning disks, backing up and restoring system disks, resetting system passwords and testing the memory. This book is an introduction to SystemRescue. It helps new users get started with SystemRescue, and it provides step-by-step guidance for performing common operations.

=== What this book covers
Chapters 1 to 5 go through the basics. We start with an overview of SystemRescue, followed by guidance for downloading and installing it on a removable boot device. We continue with instructions to start the system using the most relevant boot parameters, navigate through the system and connect to the network.

Chapters 6 to 9 give you the essential knowledge and commands required to access and administrate disks from SystemRescue. You learn how disks are structured, how to identify file systems and access their contents and which disk utilities are available.

Chapters 10 to 14 provide guidance for performing common operations based on the background in the previous chapters. These guides show you how to recover data files from a computer on which the operating system is broken, how to clone disks, how to backup and restore disk contents using image files, how to use chroot to fix Linux systems and how to reset a forgotten local Windows password.

It is highly recommended that you read the first nine chapters in the normal order, unless you already have the skills, as each chapter provides essential information needed to understand what follows.

Chapters 10 to 14 can be read in any order, depending on your needs and interests. Ideally, you should read them all to have a good understanding of what SystemRescue can help you do. If you are in a hurry, you can skip some of these chapters and focus on what is most relevant to you. These later chapters make constant use of the knowledge from the first part of the book. Hence you are invited to refer to earlier chapters when necessary.

The technical details provided in this book are accurate at the time of publication. Please keep in mind that software changes quickly, so some details in this book might be different from what you find on your computer. What is most important is that you understand the general principles. These should remain valid for the long term.

=== Who should read this book
This book is targeted at users who are new to SystemRescue and want to perform computer maintenance operations using free software. You need good computer skills, and you should not be afraid to use command-line interfaces. Familiarity with Linux commands helps, but it is not required to use this book, as new commands are introduced with examples.

=== Use utilities with caution
It is important to understand well how the utilities mentioned in this book should be used, as they can cause damage if they are misused. Pay attention to details, as small mistakes can have a big impact. Most commands in the examples refer to resources such as disk names which are specific to a particular situation. So, make sure you adapt the commands in the examples to your situation before you execute them. To minimize risks, it is highly recommended that you regularly back up all essential data, especially before you perform sensitive operations.
