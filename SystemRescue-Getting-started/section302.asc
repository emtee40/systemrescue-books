== Appendix 2: How to Customise Boot Entries
It is possible to customise the SystemRescue entries in the boot menus if it has been installed on a writable file system such as FAT32 on a writable device. This is what you get if you install SystemRescue using Rufus in ISO mode as described in <<chapter_prepare>>. These customisations allow you to boot SystemRescue using your preferred boot options without having to modify these entries each time you use SystemRescue. For example, you can use this to automatically configure the keyboard layout when you start SystemRescue from the default entry in the menu. The two boot menus can be modified by editing the following two files which are located on the SystemRescue boot device: `sysresccd_sys.cfg` and `grubsrcd.cfg`. Please refer to <<chapter_starting>> for more details about how boot entries work and <<appendix_bootparam>> for a list of all common boot parameters.

=== BIOS boot menu
As an example, here is the definition of the first entry in the Legacy BIOS boot menu in `sysresccd_sys.cfg`:
[subs=+quotes]
----
LABEL sysresccd
TEXT HELP
Boot the SystemRescue live medium.
ENDTEXT
MENU LABEL Boot SystemRescue using default options
LINUX boot/x86_64/vmlinuz
INITRD boot/intel_ucode.img,boot/amd_ucode.img,boot/x86_64/sysresccd.img
APPEND archisobasedir=sysresccd archisolabel=RESCUE700
----

Customizations can be made on the line starting with the `APPEND` keyword. Let's say you use a French keyboard and you always want to copy the contents of the system into memory during the boot. You could add the following two parameters at the end of this line:
[subs=+quotes]
----
setkmap=fr-latin1 copytoram
----

=== UEFI boot menu
Here is the definition of the default boot entry in the UEFI boot menu in `grubsrcd.cfg`:
[subs=+quotes]
----
menuentry "Boot SystemRescue using default options" {
        set gfxpayload=keep
        linux /sysresccd/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz archisobasedir=sysresccd archisolabel=RESCUE700
        initrd /sysresccd/boot/intel_ucode.img /sysresccd/boot/amd_ucode.img /sysresccd/boot/x86_64/sysresccd.img
----

This time, changes should be made on the line starting with `linux`. The path to the `vmlinuz` kernel image file must remain in its original location, just after the `linux` keyword. You can add more boot parameters at the end of the line.

=== Warning
Please make sure all parameters are separated by spaces and that you do not insert new line breaks. Also, make sure you do not change the value of the `archisolabel` parameter without understanding the implications. This value changes with each version of SystemRescue. It is used to identify the device where SystemRescue is installed during the boot process. Hence the value of this parameter must match the volume name of the device where it is installed. Otherwise, SystemRescue will fail to boot.
