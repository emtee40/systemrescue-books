== Chapter 14: How to Reset a Local Windows Password
This chapter guides you through the process of resetting a local user password on a Windows system. You must reset such a password if you have forgotten it and you cannot sign in. The current approach is applicable only for passwords stored on the local disk. It won't work if you sign in using an online Microsoft account.

SystemRescue comes with `chntpw`. This program can modify the `SAM` file, where Windows stores local passwords. You execute the following steps in a terminal from SystemRescue to access the Windows system disk. Then, you use `chntpw` to clear the password associated with your user account.

=== Identifying the Windows disk
The first step is to identify the partition where Windows is installed using `lsblk` in a terminal:

----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *lsblk -o path,size,fstype,label,model*
PATH        SIZE FSTYPE      LABEL    MODEL
/dev/sdc  465.8G                      Samsung_SSD_850_EVO_mSATA
/dev/sdc1     4G vfat        UEFI_ESP
/dev/sdc2   5.2G btrfs       boot
/dev/sdc3 406.5G crypto_LUKS
/dev/sdc4    16M
/dev/sdc5    40G ntfs        Windows
/dev/sdc6     2G vfat        SOFTWARE
/dev/sdc7     8G btrfs       Fedora
----

You should be able to identify the Windows partition as it should have an NTFS file system, and you may recognize its size and volume name. In the current example, Windows is installed on the device identified as `/dev/sdc5`.

=== Mounting the Windows disk
Next, create a mount point and name it `windows`:
[subs=+quotes]
----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *mkdir -p /mnt/windows*
----

The Windows file system must be mounted using the device name previously identified, such as `/dev/sdc5` in this example. The full read-write access mode is used so the files where passwords are stored can be modified.
[subs=+quotes]
----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *mount -v /dev/sdc5 /mnt/windows*
mount: /dev/sdc5 mounted on /mnt/windows.
----

Make sure you can find the `SAM` file. The `find` command shows a list of all files with such a name on this file system:
[subs=+quotes]
----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *find /mnt/windows -name SAM*
/mnt/windows/Windows/System32/config/SAM
/mnt/windows/Windows/SysWOW64/LogFiles/SAM
----
We are interested in the `SAM` file located in the `System32/config` directory. If this file cannot be found, you might have used the wrong device. In that case, go back to the first step.

=== Clearing the password
Once the Windows file system and the SAM file are accessible, you are ready to manipulate local Windows accounts using the `chntpw` command. First, show the list of local user accounts by specifying option `-l` with this command followed by the path to the SAM file which was found in the previous step:

[root@sysrescue ~]# *chntpw -l /mnt/windows/Windows/System32/config/SAM*

| RID -|---------- Username ------------| Admin? |- Lock? --|
| 01f4 | Administrator                  | ADMIN  | dis/lock |
| 01f7 | DefaultAccount                 |        | dis/lock |
| 03e9 | francois                       | ADMIN  |          |

| 01f8 | WDAGUtilityAccount             |        | dis/lock |
----

You should recognize the name of your local Windows user account in the list. Now let's use `chntpw` with the `-u` option to specify the name of the user account which needs a password reset, followed by the path to the `SAM` file:

[subs=+quotes]
----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *chntpw -u francois /mnt/windows/Windows/System32/config/SAM*
chntpw version 1.00 140201, (c) Petter N Hagen
Hive </mnt/windows/Windows/System32/config/SAM> name (from header): <\SystemRoot\System32\Config\SAM>
ROOT KEY at offset: 0x001020 * Subkey indexing type is: 686c <lh>
File size 65536 [10000] bytes, containing 7 pages (+ 1 headerpage)
Used for data: 318/32040 blocks/bytes, unused: 30/12792 blocks/bytes.

- - - - User Edit Menu:
 1 - Clear (blank) user password
(2 - Unlock and enable user account) [seems unlocked already]
 3 - Promote user (make user an administrator)
 4 - Add user to a group
 5 - Remove user from a group
 q - Quit editing user, back to user select
----

As explained in the instructions on the screen, you now press `1` + `Enter` to clear the user password, then `q` + `Enter` to quit the menu. Finally press `y` + `Enter` to confirm you want to save the modifications made in the `SAM` file.

=== Unmounting the Windows disk
When you have completed the changes, you should unmount the Windows disk before you can shut down or reboot the computer.
[subs=+quotes]
----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *umount /mnt/windows*
----

=== Setting a new password
After the reboot you should be able to sign in on Windows using your local account without any password. You can then press `Ctrl+Alt+Delete` and select `change a password` to set a new password on your account.
