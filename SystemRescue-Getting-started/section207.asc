== Chapter 7: Identifying Disks

=== Disk names on Linux
Many administrative tasks involve reading and writing to and from disks, so it is important to know how to access these devices from SystemRescue. The operating system allocates a device name to each disk. You use these names to run disk-related operations.

Different types of disks use different naming schemes. SATA disks are allocated names such as `/dev/sda` for the first device, `/dev/sdb` for the second such disk, and so on. NVMe disks get names such as `/dev/nvme0n1`, then `/dev/nvme0n2`, etc.

The partitions on a disk are identified by a number that follows the name of the disk. If the name of the disk ends with a number, the letter `p` is used to separate the partition number from the name of the disk. Here are a few examples:

* `/dev/sda1` is the first partition on disk `/dev/sda`
* `/dev/nvme0n1p1` is the first partition on disk `/dev/nvme0n1`
* `/dev/nvme0n1p2` is the second partition on disk `/dev/nvme0n1`

=== Identifying disk devices
SystemRescue comes with GParted. It is a graphical partition editor that allows you to identify disks and partitions easily. The main window shows the contents of one disk at a time. If you have multiple disks on your computer, you can switch between them using the drop-down list in the top right corner of the window.

GParted shows disk layouts in two ways. At the top of the window is a graphical view of the partitions. The bottom shows the same partitions as a list with more details. The screenshot above shows an example of a SATA disk named `/dev/sdc` which contains six partitions.

You can also use the `lsblk` command in a terminal to identify disks. In the example below this command is used with additional options to specify which attributes to display for each device:

----
[root@sysrescue ~]# *lsblk -o path,size,fstype,label,model*
PATH        SIZE FSTYPE      LABEL     MODEL
/dev/sdc  465.8G                       Samsung_SSD_850_EVO_mSATA
/dev/sdc1     4G vfat        UEFI_ESP
/dev/sdc2   5.2G btrfs       boot
/dev/sdc3 406.5G crypto_LUKS
/dev/sdc4    16M
/dev/sdc5    42G ntfs        Windows
/dev/sdc6     8G vfat        SOFTWARE
----

The `lsblk` command shows the most important attributes for each disk and partition. As you can see in the example above it provides the model of the disk, the type and label of each file system, and the size of each device. These help you to identify your disks and find which device name to specify when you perform an operation involving disks or partitions. This command is used extensively in the following chapters.
