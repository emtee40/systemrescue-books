== Chapter 1: Introduction to SystemRescue
=== Project objective
SystemRescue, formerly known as SystemRescueCd, is a Linux distribution intended to be used for administrating or recovering computer systems and data. It is often run from removable media such as USB memory sticks so it can be used on computers where the operating system has stopped working. It comes with many programs to carry out system administration tasks. It is based on Linux, but it also operates on Windows computers as it supports all mainstream file systems. SystemRescue is completely free to use.

Here are some examples of what you can do with SystemRescue:

* You might need to repartition disks when you purchase a new disk, reinstall the operating system, or just want to modify how the disk space is allocated.
* You might have to recover data files stored on a local disk if the operating system has stopped working. Important data files should be transferred to an external disk or another computer over a network before the disk is erased and the system reinstalled.
* Creating a physical copy of an internal disk allows you to restore all its contents in a single operation if the computer is affected by a critical software issue or disk failure. Having such a physical copy is very useful if your operating system stops working after a faulty system update, because of malware such as a virus, or if the primary disk must be replaced because of a hardware failure.
* Resetting the password of a local user account on either a Linux or a Windows system allows you to restore access to the system if you forget your password.
* You can use SystemRescue to fix system or configuration changes which are keeping Linux from starting.
* You can run a memory test when you experience random problems or crashes and you want to know if this is caused by damaged memory modules.

SystemRescue is based on Linux, so it can naturally be used to administrate Linux systems. But it also works with Windows computers, as it can access data stored on FAT and NTFS file systems. It supports a wide range of hardware devices and file systems. This is essential as you can use the system and access your data only if your hardware is properly supported. Also, the Linux ecosystem provides lots of free utilities. SystemRescue gives you access to many such administration and recovery programs. It also comes with general applications such as text editors and web browsers. However, software which is not related to system administration such as word processors and music players is not included in SystemRescue so it stays as compact as possible.

=== The SystemRescue way
SystemRescue comes with a lot of tools so you can administrate computer systems and recover data files. But it will not resolve problems automatically for you. To use it effectively, you must know which programs to use and and how to use them. There are many ways to learn how to use these programs. This book helps you get started with SystemRescue, but you can do much more than what is documented here. Most programs included in SystemRescue come with offline reference documentation, which can be accessed from the system without having to be connected to the internet. You can also find good tutorials on the internet to learn how to use a specific program to solve a particular issue.

The large choice of programs allows you to perform some operations in multiple ways so you can decide which approach is best for you. Some utilities are controlled through graphical interfaces but most are based on command lines. In general, graphical tools are easier to use, but command-line programs give you more control and flexibility. For example, you can take advantage of Linux shell pipelines to combine multiple commands to perform operations more effectively. You can even automate tasks which you must execute regularly by writing shell scripts or using Perl, Python or Ruby, which are all included.

If you have advanced needs, it is possible to boot SystemRescue from the network instead of using removable devices. This is particularly useful when you have to manage multiple computers, as you can deploy SystemRescue on a central server. This way, you can update SystemRescue more easily, and you can manage the configuration and possible customisations in one place.

=== Upstream distribution
Since version 6.0, SystemRescue is based on Arch Linux, which is a popular Linux distribution. Hence most components included in SystemRescue are provided exactly as packaged by Arch Linux. This upstream project is developed by a large number of users. That community builds all components from source code, applies patches to fix bugs, keeps the software up to date, and makes sure all packages are consistent and work well together. The Arch Linux project also provides very good documentation, so it is a good place to find detailed information about specific programs in SystemRescue.

The official Arch Linux project is currently available only for the 64-bit PC architecture (amd64/x86_64). It used to be provided for 32-bit PCs (i686) as well, but the popularity of that architecture has decreased so support was discontinued in 2017. Arch Linux 32 is a derivative project which continues to distribute 32-bit packages. This allows a 32-bit version of SystemRescue to be provided. Arch Linux 32 is not as active as the main project, hence 32-bit versions of packages are often released days or weeks after the 64-bit versions. It is important to keep in mind that the number of people who use 32-bit hardware and software keeps decreasing. Hence fewer users are reporting issues that specifically affect 32-bit programs, and fewer developers are interested in maintaining those programs. As 64-bit hardware has been available for a very long time, it is strongly recommended that you use the 64-bit edition of SystemRescue if you can.
