== Chapter 9: Partitioning Disks

=== Overview
SystemRescue comes with many utilities for partitioning disks. They allow you to create, resize, move and delete partitions and the corresponding file systems.

There are many reasons to change the way disks are partitioned. You must normally create partitions and file systems before you can use a new disk. Also, if you copy an old disk to a larger new one, you must change the disk layout so the additional disk space can be used. In this case, you can either create new partitions or resize existing ones to allocate the extra space.

At times, you might want to replace a large partition with multiple smaller ones. For example, many new computers have disks where most of the space is allocated to a single partition. This default layout is simple, but it can be sub-optimal. It is often a good idea to store the operating system files and personal data on different partitions. This allows you to perform operations on the system partition without affecting your personal data files. If you create an image of the disk as described in <<chapter_diskphyscopy>> and your operating system stops working, you can restore the system from the disk image. If your data are located on a separate partition, you could restore the system without affecting your data.

You must be very cautious when you work on disk partitions, as these operations can cause you to lose data if things go wrong. It is highly recommended that you back up your data before you start. Also, you can create a physical copy of an entire disk as explained in <<chapter_diskphyscopy>>. This allows you to restore the entire disk contents if there is any issue during the operation.

=== Partitions and file systems
It is essential to understand the difference between partitions and file systems. A partition is just a subset of a physical disk. It is implemented as an entry in the partition table which indicates its location on the disk and its attributes. In general partitions contains file systems which determines how files and directories are organised. A particular file system can make use of all the space allocated to the corresponding partition. In the current chapter, the term "volume" is used to refer to the combination of a partition and the file system it contains.

Most disk partitioning activities involve manipulating both a partition and the corresponding file system. It is essential that the two operations are consistent. For example, you may have a 500GB disk which contains just a single volume where your operating system is installed. If the file system on this partition contains a lot of free space you might want to shrink this volume to 100GB to make space for another volume of 400GB where you could store data files. Shrinking the current 500GB volume involves two operations:

* First, you shrink the file system to 100GB so the file system structures and data are moved to the first 100GB in this partition. As a result, you have a 500GB partition which contains a 100GB file system.
* Next, you shrink the partition to 100GB, by modifying the entry in the partition table, to make space for other partitions.

It is important to apply these two operations in the right order so the file system is never larger than the partition it belongs to. Shrinking the partition to 100GB while the file system is still using 500GB would cause the file system to be truncated and it would become unusable. Growing a volume involves doing the two operations in the opposite order: you must grow the partition before you grow its file system.

There are three categories of utilities involved in disk partitioning:

* Programs such as fdisk and gdisk manipulate partitions by working on the partition table, but they do not operate at the file system level.
* Each type of file system comes with its own set of utilities for performing administration tasks. These include creating new file systems and resizing existing ones. These tools do not perform any change on partition tables.
* Tools such as GParted operate on both partitions and file systems and make disk partitioning much easier.

=== Graphical partitioning tool
GParted is the best tool for most disk partitioning activities. It has a graphical user interface and it is very user friendly. It modifies both partition tables and the corresponding file systems so both structures are modified in a consistent way during an operation.

It supports all mainstream types of partition tables and file systems. It relies on file system specific utilities to perform operations on file systems, so these have to be installed. SystemRescue comes with all common file system tools.

GParted shows a graphical representation of the disk space so it is very easy to visualise how the disk space is allocated. If your computer has multiple disks, use the drop-down list at the top of the window to switch from one disk to another. Partitions and their corresponding file systems can easily be created, deleted, moved or resized by clicking on actions in the menus. Such operations are not applied immediately. The graphical representation of the disk is updated so you can visualise what effect pending operations would have. Once you are satisfied with the new disk layout you must apply pending operations, either from the menus or by clicking on the green tick in the toolbar.

If you are setting up a new disk, or if you want to reinitialise an existing disk, you can create a new partition table. This action replaces all existing partitions and causes all data on the disk to be lost. This operation can be triggered from the main menu, where you select the type of partition table you want to use. Unlike other operations, this change takes effect as soon as you validate the operation.

=== Advanced partition manipulation tools
You can also use partition manipulation tools such as fdisk and gdisk. These allow you to create, modify or delete entries in a partition table. Old versions of fdisk did not support GPT partition tables but this has now been implemented. The gdisk utility has the same features as fdisk for GPT partition tables. It can convert an MBR/MSDOS partition table to GPT. These two programs can be executed in a terminal and they are controlled by selecting options interactively from a list of choices. The cfdisk and cgdisk programs provide the same types of features with an alternative user interface in which partitions and commands are selected using arrow keys.

You can use these partition manipulation tools to perform operations that are not supported in GParted. This includes growing a file system which GParted does not support. You would have to grow the partition using one of these tools and then you grow the corresponding file system using its specific utilities.

Please use the `man` command in a terminal to get more details about how these programs operate. For example type `man fdisk` in a terminal to get the fdisk manual page.

=== File system utilities
SystemRescue comes with utilities to administrate all mainstream file systems such as EXT4, XFS, BTRFS, FAT and NTFS. These tools allow you to perform the following types of operations:

* All mainstream file systems have their own `mkfs` utilities to create a new file system on a partition or disk device (`mkfs.ext4`, `mkfs.xfs`, `mkfs.btrfs`, `mkfs.fat`, `mkfs.ntfs`)
* The `fsck` utilities allow you to verify the structure of a file system and fix errors (`fsck.ext4`, `fsck.xfs`, `fsck.btrfs`, `fsck.fat`, `ntfsfix`)
* Most file systems can be resized but the corresponding utilities have different names. EXT4 are resized using `resize2fs`. XFS file systems can be extended using `xfs_growfs`. BTRFS file systems can be managed using the general `btrfs` utility which provides a sub-command to perform a resizing operation. NTFS file systems can be resized using `ntfsresize`.
* Most file systems have additional commands to perform various operations such as enabling or disabling features and changing the volume name. Here are examples: `tune2fs`, `xfs_admin`, `btrfs`.

File systems are resized either online (when they are mounted) or offline (when they are not mounted). Each type of file system has its own capabilities. For example, EXT4 can be extended either online or offline but it can be shrunk only offline. XFS file systems can be extended online or offline but they cannot be shrunk. BTRFS file systems can be extended or shrunk, but those operations must be run online. NTFS file systems must be resized offline with the current Linux utilities.
