== Chapter 2: Preparing the Boot Device

=== Downloading the ISO image
The first thing to do is to download SystemRescue. To get a genuine copy, make sure you download it from the official website: https://www.system-rescue.org/.

The main file to download is the ISO image file. This one file contains everything you need to use SystemRescue. The ISO image is quite large, so you will need a decent internet connection. It is strongly recommended that you download the 64-bit edition (amd64/x86_64) unless your hardware supports only 32-bit software.

You should get the latest version available unless there is a particular reason to use an older version. The instructions below are based on version 7.00, but the process should be very similar in later versions.

=== Verifying the integrity of the ISO image
The download page also provides checksums so you can verify the integrity of the ISO image file you downloaded. Each checksum file is named after a specific version of the ISO image. These checksums are sequences of numbers and letters derived from the contents of the original ISO image file. Any changes in the file would cause a checksum to be completely different. Hence you can make sure your download is strictly identical to the original ISO image by calculating the checksum of your copy and comparing it to the checksum provided on the website.

For example, here is the SHA256 checksum that corresponds to version 7.00 for the amd64 architecture. You can find it in a file named `systemrescue-7.00-amd64.iso.sha256`:

Verifying a checksum does not take long, and it gives you a chance to immediately fix the problem if you get an invalid copy of the ISO image. This will help you avoid unexpected issues when you use SystemRescue. The website provides multiple types of checksums. They are all effective and widely used. You need just one checksum to verify the integrity of the download. Make sure the checksum file corresponds to the correct version and architecture by comparing the names of the files.

To calculate a SHA256 checksum on Linux, use the `sha256sum` command followed by the path to your copy of the ISO image in a terminal:
[subs=+quotes]
----
[user@localhost]$ *sha256sum systemrescue-7.00-amd64.iso*
ab7fc8a073f09ad7b093ba42bf7a49681954e5567df182766a0343aeeba1251c  systemrescue-7.00-amd64.iso
----

On Windows you can launch a command prompt from the menu, go to the download folder using `cd`, and then use the `certutil` command as in the following example:
[subs=+quotes]
----
C:\> *cd \temp*
C:\temp> *certutil -hashfile systemrescue-7.00-amd64.iso sha256*
SHA256 hash of systemrescue-7.00-amd64.iso:
ab7fc8a073f09ad7b093ba42bf7a49681954e5567df182766a0343aeeba1251c
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.

After you calculate the checksum of your copy of the ISO image, you should compare it with the contents of the checksum file that you downloaded. Something has gone wrong if the checksum of your copy of the ISO image is different from the expected checksum. There could have been a corruption during the download, the file could have been downloaded partially, or it might have been written on a damaged disk. In these cases, you can try again or you can download the ISO image to a different computer so you get a valid file.

If you do not want to verify the checksum of the ISO image at this stage you can specify a particular boot option when you start SystemRescue. That way the checksum of the system image is verified during initialisation. This can be a good alternative, as it takes less effort but it verifies the integrity only of the main system file. This is documented in the next chapter.

=== Choosing the right boot device
The next step is to install SystemRescue on a bootable device. There are two popular options.

Originally SystemRescue was designed to run from CD-ROM media, but you can use a DVD-ROM because it has more capacity. Most computers that still have optical drives should be able to read DVD-ROMs. However, many newer computers, especially compact laptops, do not have optical drives. Therefore, memory sticks are the best type of removable devices to run SystemRescue.

All data on the target device will be deleted during the installation, so you must backup your data before you use that device for SystemRescue. You may also prefer to purchase a new device. Make sure the size of the boot device is bigger than the size of the ISO image. Ideally, it should be a good quality device to avoid problems. It should also be fast, so the system can start quickly. Hence USB 3 memory sticks are recommended over older models.

=== Preparing a bootable DVD-ROM
The first option is to install SystemRescue on a DVD-ROM. It is very important to burn the ISO file in the right way. Do not add the ISO file to a disc as an ordinary data file. The ISO file is an image of the whole device, so it must be written in such a particular way.

On Windows 10, this can be done easily by clicking on the ISO file (in Windows explorer) with the right button of the mouse. A contextual menu should show an entry to `Burn disc image`. This is the simplest solution, but you can use alternative programs if you prefer.

On Linux, ISO images can be written to DVDs using programs such as K3B, Brasero and XfBurn or by using command-line tools.

=== Preparing a memory stick on Windows
You need a specific program to install SystemRescue on a memory stick. Rufus is highly recommended for this task. You can download it for free from https://rufus.ie/.

Once you download Rufus, execute it on your computer then insert the memory stick. At the top of the screen, a drop-down menu will list all removable devices on the computer. They should be easy to identify thanks to their volume names and sizes. Select the relevant memory stick. Next, select the ISO image that you downloaded. When you select these two items, Rufus refreshes the screen to show options that are relevant in the current situation.

It is recommended that you select `MBR` as the partition scheme and `BIOS or UEFI` as the target system so your memory stick can be used on any type of PC.

Next, look at the box where the volume name of the memory stick can be edited. Rufus automatically detects the name from the ISO image and reuses it by default. It is essential not to change the original volume name as it is used during the boot process to identify the device that contains SystemRescue files.

The device should be initialised with a `FAT32` file system and the default cluster size. Other options may be available depending on the version of Rufus. In general, default choices should be fine. Once you are ready, click on `Start`. Rufus will ask if the image should be written in `ISO mode` or `DD mode`. Both options will provide a usable boot device. It is recommended that you choose `ISO mode` so the memory stick is prepared with a writable file system using the full size of the device. This allows you to use the remaining space on the memory stick to store additional files, and it also allows SystemRescue files such as boot menu entries to be modified. In `DD mode`, the memory stick will be bootable but the remaining disk space will not be accessible for storing additional files.

=== Preparing a memory stick on Linux
The recommended utility for installing SystemRescue on a memory stick from Linux is `usbimager`. It is very compact, and it comes with minimal dependencies. It is available for free at https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager, and it can be executed without installation. Multiple download formats are available. The X11 version is the best choice for most users. Once you download the ZIP file, extract the files in it. Then execute the program from the disk.

This program is very simple to use. Select the ISO image and the target memory stick, using the graphical interface, then click on the `Write` button to start the installation. This is like performing the installation using Rufus in DD mode, so the memory stick will be bootable. However, the additional disk capacity will not be available for storing additional files.
